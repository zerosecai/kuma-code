/**
 * Guards against accidentally inheriting workflows from upstream opencode.
 *
 * We regularly merge upstream. When upstream adds a new workflow under
 * `.github/workflows/`, it silently starts running in our CI unless we
 * explicitly review and accept it. This check makes that decision explicit:
 * the list of allowed workflows is hardcoded below, and any drift (added or
 * removed file in `.github/workflows/` or `.github/workflows/disabled/`) fails
 * CI until the list is updated deliberately.
 *
 * To accept a new workflow: add its filename to `active` (or `disabled`).
 * To drop one: remove its filename from the list.
